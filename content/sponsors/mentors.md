## Becoming a Mentor

Whether you are an FRC Alumni, family of a team member or a person just looking to help out, allow us to show you the way!

Step one to becoming a mentor is to ask! If you've made it here, you probably have a way to contact a member of the club. They might be a student or a mentor, but either way, you should get in touch and ask how you can best assist us. If you don't have contact information for someone in the club, you can [contact us](/contact).

Please always remember when you're mentoring for our team (as well as any FIRST team!) to follow the [FIRST Youth Protection Policy (YPP)](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-protection-policy). Importantly, **when in contact with a student who is under 18, please ensure that you loop another person into the conversation**.
