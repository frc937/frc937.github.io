We are Shawnee Mission North's FRC (First Robotics Competition) team, Our team number is 937, which means we were
one of the first 1000's teams to join the FRC family. Our club was started in 2002 with the name "The North Stars".
One of the first Mentors was Bill Kirchner, who at the time was the Robotics teacher at SMN. The first competition our team competed in was in St. Louis. The Robot had to be sent by mail to the competition. The robot also had to be 30 pounds, which the night before was done, when they first measured it before shipping it was a few pounds over, so they drilled holes in the metal to make the robot lighter.
