We are Shawnee Mission North's FRC (First Robotics Competition) team, Our team number is 937, which means we were
one of the first 1000's teams to join the FRC family. Our club was started in 2002 with the name "The North Stars".
One of the first Mentors was Bill Kirchner, who at the time was the Robotics teacher at SMN. The first competition our team competed in was in St. Louis. The Robot had to be sent by mail to the competition. The robot also had to be 30 pounds, which the night before was done, when they first measured it before shipping it was a few pounds over, so they drilled holes in the metal to make the robot lighter. (More information is being learned). In the past 3 years (2022-2025), we have done a LOT. We had the same two student leaders for our 23 and 24 season; these students were 2024 grads. We got a new set of student leaders, still in groups of two. This new group did their best, but we did have a slight decline in our club all around (not necessarily their fault). We are actively looking for more teacher sponsors to help our club thrive. I will update more as this new season comes.
