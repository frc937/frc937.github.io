      <description>We are Shawnee Mission North&amp;rsquo;s FRC (First Robotics Competition) team, Our team number is 937, which means we were one of the first 1000&amp;rsquo;s teams to join the FRC family. Our club was started in 2002 with the name &amp;ldquo;The North Stars&amp;rdquo;. One of the first Mentors was Bill Kirchner, who at the time was the Robotics teacher at SMN. The first competition our team competed in was in St. Louis.</description>
